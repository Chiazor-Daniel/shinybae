# üõçÔ∏è ShinyBae + Shopify Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you integrate your beautiful ShinyBae app with Shopify's real commerce capabilities in just a few steps!

## üìã Prerequisites

- A Shopify store (free 14-day trial available)
- Basic knowledge of environment variables
- Your ShinyBae app running locally

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Shopify Store

1. **Sign up for Shopify**: Go to [shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com) and start your free trial
2. **Choose a store name**: Something like `shinybae-cosmetics` (this becomes your domain)
3. **Complete basic setup**: Add your business details

### Step 2: Install Headless Channel

1. **Go to Shopify App Store**: In your admin, click "Apps"
2. **Search for "Headless"**: Install the official Shopify Headless app (it's free)
3. **Open the Headless app**: Click on it from your Apps list

### Step 3: Generate Public Access Token

1. **In Headless app**: Click "Create storefront"
2. **Name your storefront**: e.g., "ShinyBae Main Site"
3. **Configure permissions**:
   - ‚úÖ Read products
   - ‚úÖ Read collections  
   - ‚úÖ Read customer tags
   - ‚úÖ Read inventory
4. **Copy the public access token**: You'll need this for your `.env` file

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` file** with your actual values:
   ```env
   # Your Shopify store domain (replace 'your-store' with your actual store name)
   VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=https://shinybae-cosmetics.myshopify.com
   
   # Paste the public access token you copied from Step 3
   VITE_SHOPIFY_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   
   # Your store's primary market (optional)
   VITE_SHOPIFY_COUNTRY=US
   VITE_SHOPIFY_LANGUAGE=en
   
   # Enable Shopify checkout by default
   VITE_USE_SHOPIFY_CHECKOUT=true
   ```

### Step 5: Add Your Products to Shopify

1. **Go to Products** in your Shopify admin
2. **Add each ShinyBae product**:
   - Product title: e.g., "ShinyBae - Classic"
   - Price: $7.15
   - Images: Upload your product images
   - Handle: Make note of this (e.g., "shinybae-classic")
   - Inventory: Set stock levels

3. **Create Collections**:
   - "Featured Products" for homepage
   - "All Products" for shop page
   - "Best Sellers" for marketing

### Step 6: Test Your Integration

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your app**: The toggle in the top-right shows Shopify status
   - ‚úÖ "Shopify Loaded" = Everything works!
   - ‚è≥ "Loading Shopify..." = Check your `.env` file

3. **Test the checkout flow**:
   - Add items to cart
   - Click "Secure Checkout"
   - Should redirect to: `your-store.myshopify.com/checkout`
